%description
SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C
and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is 
primarily used with common scripting languages such as Perl, PHP, Python,
Tcl/Tk, and Ruby, however the list of supported languages also includes
non-scripting languages such as C#, Common Lisp (CLISP, Allegro CL, UFFI),
Java, Modula-3, OCAML, Octave, and R. Also several interpreted and compiled
Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme, Chicken) are supported. SWIG is 
most commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming 
environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++
software. SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML and Lisp
s-expressions.
