Description: |
    SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C
    and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is 
    primarily used with common scripting languages such as Perl, PHP, Python,
    Tcl/Tk, and Ruby, however the list of supported languages also includes
    non-scripting languages such as C#, Common Lisp (CLISP, Allegro CL, UFFI),
    Java, Modula-3, OCAML, Octave, and R. Also several interpreted and compiled
    Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme, Chicken) are supported. SWIG is 
    most commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming 
    environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++
    software. SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML and Lisp
    s-expressions.
